<h1>RPEDS: The Reenvisioned Public [Open] Education Data Syndicate</h1>
<i>Proper noun:</i> An informal group of data wonks collectively working to develop a lightweight database containing open demographic and education data to streamline cleaning, direct queries, and analysis for experienced data users.  
<i>Pronunciation:</i> /OUR-peds/          
<i>Common Mispronunciations:</i> /I-peds/, /MY-peds/, /THEIR-peds/, /YOUR-peds/ 

<h2>Background</h2>
The RPEDS will host and maintain an inexpensive, lightweight relational database containing frequently used open data primarily from government and nonprofit sources. Data will be cleaned and compiled to ease analysis over time and modified with new and adjusted fields specific to data. <p>
The RPEDS database will be consistent, authoritative, and centrally stored in order to create efficiencies for researchers, developers and state agencies who currently do the same work in silos with different business rules and categorizations that lead to different results.<p>
While starting in the State of Washington, RPEDS will also include data for states and frequently used geographies  to allow both for comparison/benchmarking and the potential to open database access to researchers in other states.<p>
Topical data will initially focus on post-secondary education, population demographics, and workforce, beginning with the U.S. Census Bureau, Department of Education’s IPEDS survey, and the Veterans Administration GI Bill Lookup Tool.
